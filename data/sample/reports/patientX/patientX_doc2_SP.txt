[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1:  BREAST, LEFT, MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY
A.	INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, 1.3 CM IN
GREATEST DIMENSION ASSOCIATED WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS.
B.	NOTTINGHAM SCORE 8/9 (TUBULES 2, NUCLEAR GRADE 3, MITOTIC RATE 3)
NOTTINGHAM GRADE 3.
C.	NO DEFINITE LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED.
D.	SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE.
E.	TUMOR IS ESTROGEN RECEPTOR NEGATIVE, PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR NEGATIVE,
HER-2/NEU NEGATIVE WITH A KI-67 INDEX OF 45%.
F.	NO EVIDENCE OF IN-SITU COMPONENT SEEN.
PART 2: AXILLARY LYMPH NODES, LEFT, BIOPSY
A. TWO OUT OF TEN AXILLARY LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC 
CARCINOMA (2/10).
B. LARGEST METASTATIC TUMOR MEASURES 2.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
C. NO EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED.

COMMENT:
Immunostaining for AE1/AE3 supports the status of the axillary lymph node.
