[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]

CLINICAL HISTORY:
50 year old peri-menopausal female who presents with new hard palpable lump
in the left breast. 

TECHNIQUE:
Full field digital mammography with CAD was performed including
routine views of both breasts, spot magnification views on the right
with a full 90 degree lateral and spot compression views on the left.

Left breast and axillary ultrasound evaluation was performed.

COMPARISON:
This study is compared to previous examinations dating back to 2004.

FINDINGS:
Heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue is present throughout
both breasts limiting the sensitivity of the mammogram. There is no evidence
of mass or calcifications in the right breast.

A large firm mass is seen in the upper outer left breast at the 12:30
o'clock region. The mass measures 1x2 cm on the CC view. Calcifications are
seen adjacent to the mass.

Ultrasound evaluation was performed on the area and a 1.2x3.4x5.6 cm hypoechoic
mass is seen in the left breast at the 12:30 o'clock region.

Ultrasound of the left axillary lymph nodes were performed revealing multiple
abnormally thickened lymph nodes. The largest lymph node has a thickened cortex
of at least 7 mm.

IMPRESSION:
A large hypoechoic mass at the 10:30 location of the left breast is highly
suggestive of a malignancy. The mass measures 1.2x3.4x5.6 cm. Ultrasound guided
core biopsy is recommended.

Abnormal left axillary lymph nodes are highly suspicious of metastatic disease.

MR evaluation of extent of disease is recommended.

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
ACR BI-RADS Category:
5: (Breast Imaging Left) Highly suggestive for malignancy
RECOMMENDATION:Ultrasound guided core biopsy
OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
5 - Highly suggestive for malignancy
