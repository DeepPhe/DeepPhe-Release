# Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction (DeepPhe) Project
## Introduction v0.2.0

This documentation describes v0.2.0 of
* the base DeepPhe system, which  
    - extracts information from plaintext documents using [Apache cTAKES&#8482;](ctakes.apache.org)   
    - summarizes information for Cancers and Tumors across mutiple documents  
    - writes results to a database   
* and [DeepPhe Viz](https://github.com/DeepPhe/DeepPhe-Viz), for visualizing the cancer patient summaries generated by the DeepPhe system.

The output of DeepPhe has elements that are specific to the following three cancer domains:
* Breast Cancer
* Ovarian Cancer
* Malignant Melanoma

The system has been tested against documents from those three domains.

Here is a pictorial example of DeepPhe processing five documents for a single patient, and summarizing the cancer information from the five documents. Some of the attributes, such as the tumor size and treatment, show future direction of DeepPhe beyond version 0.2.0.

## Quick Start
1. [Install the base](../../wiki/Quick-Start) DeepPhe system.
2. [Install DeepPhe-Viz](../../../DeepPhe-Viz/blob/master/README.md), the DeepPhe Visualizer.


## Using DeepPhe
1. Preparing the documents you would like to process
    - Save the documents as plaintext files, one directory per patient 
    - [Naming](../../wiki/Naming-Input-Files) the files you would like to process
2. [Configuring](../../wiki/Input-and-Output-Directories) your input and output directories
3. [Telling](../../wiki/Cancer-Domains) the system which cancer domain your files belong to
4. [Listing](../../wiki/Section-Headings) the section headings used by your institution
2. [Running](../../wiki/Quick-Start) the DeepPhe system
3. [Inspecting](../../wiki/DeepPhe-Output) the output files
4. [Viewing](../../../DeepPhe-Viz/blob/master/README.md) the results using DeepPhe-Viz
5. [Accessing](../../wiki/Quick-Start#output-data-in-neo4j) the neo4j database directly  
    - This release of DeepPhe uses neo4j 3.2.x. WARNING - do not simply download the latest version of neo4j.
