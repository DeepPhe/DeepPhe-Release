# Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction (DeepPhe) Project
## Introduction v0.3.0

This documentation describes v0.3.0 of
* the base DeepPhe system, which  
    - extracts information from plaintext documents using [Apache cTAKES](ctakes.apache.org)&#8482;   
    - summarizes information for Cancers and Tumors across mutiple documents  
    - writes results to a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database
* and [DeepPhe Viz](https://github.com/DeepPhe/DeepPhe-Viz), for visualizing the cancer patient summaries generated by the DeepPhe system.

The system has been tested using documents from three cancer domains:
* Breast Cancer
* Ovarian Cancer
* Malignant Melanoma

Here is a pictorial example of DeepPhe processing five documents for a single patient, and summarizing the cancer information from the five documents. Some of the attributes, such as the tumor size and treatment, show future direction of DeepPhe beyond version 0.3.0.

## Quick Start
1. [Install the base](../../wiki/Quick-Start) DeepPhe system.
2. [Install DeepPhe-Viz](../../../DeepPhe-Viz/blob/master/README.md), the DeepPhe Visualizer.


## Using DeepPhe
1. [Name](../../wiki/Naming-Input-Files) the files you would like to process
2. [Run](../../wiki/Quick-Start) the DeepPhe system
3. [View](../../../DeepPhe-Viz/blob/master/README.md) the results using DeepPhe-Viz
    - This release of DeepPhe uses neo4j 3.5.x. WARNING - do not simply download the latest version of neo4j.
