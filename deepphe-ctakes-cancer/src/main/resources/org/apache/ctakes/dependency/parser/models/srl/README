############################
The model mayo-en-srl-1.3.0.jar was provided by Jinho Choi and is trained on the 
development set of the OntoNotes corpus version 4.0.  More information about this data can 
be found here:
http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/docs/LDC2011T03/OntoNotes-Release-4.0.pdf

This model produces semantic role labels over a dependency tree.  So unlike PropBank,
predicates and arguments only span the head expression.  Knowing the full argument span
will require traversal of the dependency tree.

Notes
#####

- Both models were trained using PennTreebank part-of-speech tags.  So, your input part-of-speech
tags should match the tags used for training this model.  The part-of-speech tag for punctuation 
symbols such as "." "," ":" ";" "(" ")" etc. are the symbols themselves (i.e. the part-of-speech tag
for the token ")" should be ")".)  This may be inconsistent with other PTB-derived tagging schemes that
may use tags such as "COLON" or "RRB".  Your part-of-speech tags should be modified to be consistent with
the tagging scheme used here.

- The models also depend on a dependency tree produced by the ClearNLP dependency parser.  This should be
run prior to running ClearNLP semantic role labeler.

- The dependency labeling scheme produced by the models provided here is separate/different from that of
the Malt parser models used by ClearTK's wrapper of the Malt parser.  You should not assume that 
the wrapper for the Clear Parser can be used interchangeably with the wrapper for the Malt Parser.
