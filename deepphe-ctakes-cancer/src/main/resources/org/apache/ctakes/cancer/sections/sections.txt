# This file is used by the sectionizer
# Format is based on format of ccda_sections.txt but without the second field (the "code")
# The format is as follows:
# name,list of n regular expressions for header names (separated by commas). Note some characters need to be escaped. To match the 3-character token *** represent it here as \*\*\*
# By default, they are Case Sensitive and spaces are trimmed.
# list of chars to escape <([{\^-=$!|]})?*+.> taken from  http://www.baeldung.com/java-regexp-escape-char
# Could simplify the creation of the below using this info:
#  It is an error to use a backslash prior to any alphabetic character that does not denote an escaped construct;
#  these are reserved for future extensions to the regular-expression language.
#  A backslash may be used prior to a non-alphabetic character regardless of whether that character is part of an unescaped construct.
# Which was taken from  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
#
### removed Synop* as a section header so Gross Desc for patientX includes the synoptic information, and staging is linked correctly in the 08.09 code
